## Project 1 :Hybrid Interpretation for Identification of Changes in Built-up Land and Building Density Based on MSI Landsat 5 TM and Sentinel 2A Imagery

This is a project I did for my degree research paper, where i identification Built-up and Building Density in Salatiga City

  *Urban Development in Salatiga City
    The abstract highlights the significant urban development in Salatiga City, evident from the ongoing population growth and increasing land use changes.
  *Data Source and Analysis Technique
    The study utilized imagery from Sentinel 2A MSI and Landsat 5 TM as data sources and tools to identify and analyze land use changes in the city. A hybrid interpretation method combining visual and digital interpretation was used to determine built-up areas and calculate building density.
  *Accurate Land Change Identification
    The analysis showed that the Sentinel 2A MSI image achieved better accuracy (91.78%) compared to Landsat 5 TM (84.93%) in identifying land changes. Maps of building density revealed a significant change in the urban index value (73,049) between 2009 and 2016. The study also provided insights into the direction of land changes, with densification leading to suburban areas and an extension of the built-up area primarily towards the west and east, likely influenced by the Salatiga City ring road and the Bawen-Salatiga toll road.
