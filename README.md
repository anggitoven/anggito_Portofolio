## Project 1 :Hybrid Interpretation for Identification of Changes in Built-up Land and Building Density Based on MSI Landsat 5 TM and Sentinel 2A Imagery

This is a project I did for my degree research paper, where i identification Built-up and Building Density in Salatiga City.You can read the paper in **[this link](https://etd.repository.ugm.ac.id/penelitian/detail/154283)**.

  * Urban Development in Salatiga City
    <p>The abstract highlights the significant urban development in Salatiga City, evident from the ongoing population growth and increasing land use changes.</p>
  * Data Source and Analysis Technique
    <p>The study utilized imagery from Sentinel 2A MSI and Landsat 5 TM as data sources and tools to identify and analyze land use changes in the city. A hybrid interpretation method combining visual and digital interpretation was used to determine built-up areas and calculate building density.</p>
  * Accurate Land Change Identification
    <p>The analysis showed that the Sentinel 2A MSI image achieved better accuracy (91.78%) compared to Landsat 5 TM (84.93%) in identifying land changes. Maps of building density revealed a significant change in the urban index value (73,049) between 2009 and 2016. The study also provided insights into the direction of land changes, with densification leading to suburban areas and an extension of the built-up area primarily towards the west and east, likely influenced by the Salatiga City ring road and the Bawen-Salatiga toll road.</p>

## Tourist Attraction Popularity Mapping based Geotagged Tweets
This is a project I did for my degree research paper,you can read the paper in **[this link](https://journals.ums.ac.id/index.php/fg/article/view/8021)**.

* Influence of Social Media on Tourist Attractions
  <p>The abstract highlights how social media has become a dominant factor in the development of tourist attractions. The rapid dissemination of information through the Internet has led to tourist attractions gaining popularity quickly, which was not as prevalent in the past when tourism promotion was limited to traditional media.</p>
* Utilization of Twitter Data for Popularity Assessment
  <p>The study utilized tweet data from Twitter as the basis to determine the popularity level of tourist attractions. Data mining was conducted using Python and the Tweepy module, and a Tweet Proximity Index (TPI) and Density Index (DI) were used to calculate the density and frequency of tweets to assess the popularity.</p>
* Medium Accuracy of Popularity Assessment
  <p>The study found that geotagged tweet data could be used to determine the popularity of a tourist attraction, achieving a medium accuracy of 76.47% for TPI and 58.82% for DI. While the approaches are not yet strong enough for decision-making, they provide a promising initial description and require further improvement and exploration of other aspects of Twitter data.</p>
